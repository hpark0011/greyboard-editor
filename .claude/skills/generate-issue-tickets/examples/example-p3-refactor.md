# Components Import cn from Single Canonical Source

## Context

The `cn` utility (a `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` wrapper) is defined canonically in `packages/utils/src/cn.ts` and exported as `@feel-good/utils/cn`. However, some UI primitives import from a local `../utils/cn` re-export, and at least two files inline their own `clsx(twMerge(...))` call instead of using the shared utility.

- **Source:** Pattern analysis during code review
- **Location:** `packages/ui/src/primitives/` (multiple files)
- **Evidence:** `grep -rn 'from.*utils/cn' packages/ui/src/` shows 3 distinct import paths for the same function.

## Goal

Every component that uses `cn` imports it from `@feel-good/utils/cn`. No local re-exports or inline wrappers exist in the UI package.

## Scope

- Replace local `../utils/cn` imports with `@feel-good/utils/cn` in all UI primitives
- Remove inline `clsx(twMerge(...))` calls and replace with `cn()`
- Delete the local `packages/ui/src/utils/cn.ts` re-export file if it becomes unused

## Out of Scope

- Changing the `cn` implementation itself
- Auditing app-level code for the same issue (separate pass)
- Adding ESLint rule to enforce the import path (separate ticket)

## Approach

Find-and-replace across `packages/ui/src/primitives/`:

1. `grep -rn 'from.*\.\./utils/cn' packages/ui/src/` to identify local re-export consumers
2. Replace each with `import { cn } from "@feel-good/utils/cn"`
3. `grep -rn 'clsx\|twMerge' packages/ui/src/primitives/` to find inline wrappers
4. Replace with `cn()` call and add the canonical import
5. Check if `packages/ui/src/utils/cn.ts` has any remaining consumers; delete if unused

- **Effort:** Small
- **Risk:** Low

## Implementation Steps

1. Run `grep -rn 'from.*\.\./utils/cn' packages/ui/src/` to identify all local re-export consumers
2. Replace each local import with `import { cn } from "@feel-good/utils/cn"`
3. Run `grep -rn 'clsx\|twMerge' packages/ui/src/primitives/` to find inline wrappers
4. Replace inline `clsx(twMerge(...))` calls with `cn()` and add the canonical import
5. Check if `packages/ui/src/utils/cn.ts` has any remaining consumers; delete if unused
6. Run `pnpm build` and `pnpm lint` to verify no regressions

## Constraints

- Deletion-only for the re-export file — do not add new files
- Must not change the behavior of any component (pure import path change)

## Resources

- Canonical source: `packages/utils/src/cn.ts`
